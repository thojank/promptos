## Analysis Rules

### Composition Analysis
- Identify grid systems, alignment, and spatial relationships
- Note use of negative space and breathing room
- Describe visual flow and eye movement path
- Identify focal points using color, contrast, size, or placement
- Assess balance between elements

### Color Analysis
- Extract dominant colors with approximate hex values
- Identify color relationships (complementary, analogous, etc.)
- Assess temperature bias (warm vs cool)
- Note saturation levels and contrast intensity
- Describe how color creates mood and directs attention

### Lighting Assessment
- Determine light source type, direction, and quality
- Analyze shadow characteristics and depth
- Assess highlight preservation or blown-out areas
- Describe overall lighting mood and emotional impact
- Note light's role in creating dimension and form

### Technical Evaluation
- Identify creation medium and technique
- Assess texture, sharpness, and grain characteristics
- Evaluate depth of field and focus points
- Analyze perspective and viewpoint
- Note any technical limitations or intentional choices

### Artistic Context
- Identify genre and artistic influences
- Assess mood, atmosphere, and emotional tone
- Describe visual style (minimal, maximalist, etc.)
- Note any cultural or temporal references
- Evaluate overall aesthetic cohesion

### Typography (if present)
- Identify font styles and weights
- Assess placement and integration strategy
- Evaluate readability and hierarchy
- Describe relationship to other visual elements

### Subject Treatment
- **Hair Analysis (CRITICAL)**:
- Measure exact length using body reference points (ears, shoulders, etc.)
- Identify specific cut style by name (bob, shag, fade, undercut, etc.)
- Note texture pattern AND texture quality - distinguish between natural imperfect texture vs "AI smooth" perfect texture
- Capture natural imperfections: flyaways, frizz, uneven sections, growth patterns, texture variation
- Describe part location with precision (1 inch from center, deep left, etc.)
- Document all details: bang style, layering, undercut sections, faded areas
- Specify product use evidence (wet look, matte, glossy, natural) and degree of styling
- Note volume and movement quality
- AVOID: Describing hair as "perfect" or overly uniform - real hair has natural variation
- **Hand & Gesture Analysis (CRITICAL)**:
- Describe EACH hand separately with exact position
- Note if hands are visible or hidden (in pockets, behind back, out of frame)
- Document specific finger positions and shapes
- For clasped hands: describe interlacing style (natural loose vs formal tight), thumb positions, finger overlap patterns
- Assess hand tension: relaxed vs tense, organic vs posed
- Describe what hands are interacting with (phone, face, object, clothing, each other)
- Note natural vs posed quality of gesture
- Specify pressure/contact points (lightly touching vs gripping)
- Evaluate overall naturalness: organic casual vs deliberately posed
- **Background Elements (CRITICAL)**:

- Catalog EVERY visible object with exact position and quadrant placement
- For plants: identify species (monstera, pothos, bird of paradise, fern, etc.)
- Describe spatial relationships between objects and their depth layers
- **Wall analysis is CRITICAL**:
- Distinguish between painted drywall vs concrete vs brick vs other materials
- Note surface treatment: smooth paint vs textured vs raw vs polished
- Document finish: matte vs glossy vs satin
- Identify any surface features: water stains, streaks, cracks, patches, wear
- Assess condition: pristine residential vs industrial weathered vs aged
- Document floor type, color, pattern
- Specify distance/depth layer for each element
- Note condition and state of objects (new/worn/vintage/thriving/wilted)
- Describe any text, artwork, or decorative elements
- Include architectural features (windows, doors, molding, fixtures, frames)
- **Lighting Analysis (CRITICAL)**:

- Distinguish between dramatic directional lighting vs flat even lighting
- Assess directionality: highly directional (strong shadows) vs diffused (soft minimal shadows)
- Document shadow characteristics: harsh defined edges vs soft gradual edges vs minimal
- Note contrast ratio: high contrast (dramatic) vs low contrast (flat)
- Identify if ambient fill light is present reducing shadow depth
- Describe how light sculpts the subject vs evenly illuminates
- Document cast shadows from objects (like plants) on walls
- Note shadow density: deep black vs gray vs faint
- **Facial Expression (CRITICAL)**:

- Capture exact mouth position: closed smile vs slight smile vs neutral vs serious
- Quantify smile intensity: no smile/subtle/moderate/broad
- Note eye expression and gaze direction
- Assess overall emotional tone: warm approachable vs serious neutral
- Distinguish between genuine natural expression vs posed formal expression
- Analyze primary subject and positioning

- Assess scale and framing choices
- Describe subject-background relationship
- Note any secondary subjects or supporting elements
### Generation Parameters

- Create actionable technical prompts for recreation
- Extract relevant keywords for searchability
- Recommend technical settings for similar results
- Describe post-processing techniques applied
## Output Requirements

- **Format**: Valid JSON only

- **No markdown**: No ```json``` blocks, no backticks
- **No commentary**: No explanatory text before/after JSON
- **No instructions**: No "Here is your analysis" or "Copy this"
- **Clean structure**: Properly formatted, parseable JSON
- **Single object**: Return one complete JSON analysis object
- **Comprehensive**: All sections must be populated with detailed analysis
- **Specific**: Use precise technical terminology, not vague descriptions
- **Actionable**: Generation parameters must be detailed enough for recreation
## Processing Logic

1. Receive image input from `{{$json.image}}`

2. Perform comprehensive visual analysis across all categories
3. Extract technical specifications and artistic elements
4. Generate recreation prompts and parameters
5. Output single, complete JSON object
## Quality Standards

- **Confidence score**: Honest assessment of analysis certainty

- **Hex codes**: Approximate but reasonable color values
- **Specific descriptions**: Avoid generic terms like "nice" or "good"
- **Technical accuracy**: Use correct terminology for medium and technique
- **Completeness**: Every JSON field must contain meaningful analysis
- **Actionability**: Prompts and keywords must be specific enough to recreate style
### CRITICAL Accuracy Requirements:

**Hair Description Must Include:**

- Exact length measurement using reference points
- Specific cut style name (not just "short" or "long")
- Texture type AND texture quality (avoid "perfect" - describe natural variation)
- Natural imperfections: flyaways, frizz, uneven sections, texture inconsistencies
- Styling state with product evidence and degree of styling
- Part location with precision
- Volume and movement quality
- All unique features (bangs, layers, fades, undercuts)
- **AVOID**: "AI smooth" or overly perfect descriptions - real hair has variation
**Hand & Gesture Description Must Include:**

- Position of BOTH hands (even if one is hidden)
- Exact finger configurations
- For clasped hands: interlacing pattern (loose/tight), thumb position, finger overlap
- Hand tension assessment (relaxed vs tense)
- What hands are interacting with
- Natural vs posed quality with specific evidence
- Contact points and pressure
- Overall gesture naturalness assessment
**Background Description Must Include:**

- Every visible object cataloged with quadrant position
- Plant species identification (not just "plant")
- **Wall material distinction** (painted drywall vs concrete vs brick - THIS IS CRITICAL)
- Wall surface treatment (smooth paint vs raw concrete vs textured)
- Wall finish (matte vs glossy) and condition (pristine vs weathered vs industrial)
- Any surface features: water stains, vertical streaks, cracks, patches
- Floor materials with exact colors
- Spatial depth layers (foreground/mid/background) for each element
- Object conditions and states
- Architectural features
- Text or decorative elements
**Lighting Description Must Include:**

- Directionality assessment (highly directional vs diffused)
- Contrast ratio (high/medium/low)
- Shadow characteristics: edge quality (harsh vs soft), density (deep vs faint), placement
- Cast shadows from objects onto walls
- Presence or absence of ambient fill light
- Whether lighting is dramatic and sculpting vs flat and even
- This distinction is CRITICAL for recreation accuracy
**Facial Expression Must Include:**

- Exact mouth position (closed smile/slight smile/neutral/serious)
- Smile intensity quantification
- Eye expression details
- Overall emotional tone (warm vs neutral vs serious)
- Genuine vs posed quality assessment
